<b>Doomworld</b>
<br><br>
I got my port listed on the <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/ports">
DoomWorld source ports page</a>, whoppee!<br>
Also, thanks to Mordeth for pointing out that wrong date (now fixed)

<b>sfdoom update</b>
<br><br>
Ok, its been 1/2 term this week, I've done a shitload of work on the
new, mbf-based sfdoom. Not least the support for 'level headers' which
hold information about the level (eg level names, music to play,
par time etc.). Which is cool.
<br><br>
As far as names go, the most popular so far has been 'SMMU' or 'Smack
My Marine Up'. I'm not quite sure though, it sounds a bit tacky.. we
shall have to wait and see.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Names</b><br><br>
I'm fed up with trying to find a name, so I've come up with a list of
suggestions from people. <a href="mailto:sfraggle@sfrag.free-online.co.uk">E-mail me</a>
and tell me which one you think is best or send in more suggestions.<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li> ENDOOM
	<li> SPISPOPD
	<li> SMMU (smack my marine up)
	<li> Duum/D00m/Doum
	<li> Slaught Marines and Bes Friends (SMBF)
	<li> 1337d00m/ leetdoom
</ul>
<br><br>
<b> "sfdoom" </b><br><br>
Oh yeah. I have decided to abandon the current sfdoom and restart it
based on MBF, at the request of <a href="mailto:mystican@cyberspace.org">
Mystican</a>. I will add back all the stuff of the original sfdoom. So
far, I have already done:
<ul>
	<li> Deathmatch III: weapons stay put, items respawn, players
		drop backpacks, barrelfrags+barrels respawn
	<li> Console. Already better than the previous one.
	<li> Vesa mode support (menu + console)
	<li> Level naming does not have to be "MAPxx" or "ExMx"
		compliant
	<li> Annoying little bugs ( chaingun sergeant shooting sound,
		fast doors make slow door sound, low health medikit)
</ul>

<b> sfdoom</b><br><br>
Still looking for a better name. In the meanwhile, the
<a href="download/sfdoom-bin.zip">binaries</a> and the
<a href="download/sfdoom-src.zip">sources</a> are up of the latest
version (1.21). So go get em already!
<br><br>

<b>More sF-Doom</b><br><br>
I've decided to release sfdoom as it is so far, and it includes an
almost finished console and a quake-style 'start map'. Get it
<a href="download/sfdoom.zip">here</a>! It's cool!<br><br>

<p align="right"><img src="img/newsbox.gif" border="0"> <b>18 Jan 98</b> <img src="img/newsbox2.gif" border="0"></p>
<b>sF-Doom</b><br><br>
Yeah, thats what it's called so far - someone send me a name :).
Anyway, sfdoom is coming along "great" - heres a list of stuff:
<table border=0>
<tr><td><b>Done</b></td>       <td><b>To do</b></td> </tr>
<tr><td>Translucency</td>      <td> Console(1/2 done) </td></tr>
<tr><td>Coloured lighting</td> <td> Music</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final doom support</td> <td> Dynamic change screen res.</td></tr>
<tr><td>New screen 'melt effect(translucent fade)</td>
	<td>Quake-style 'start map'</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
Heh.. i'm still not releasing it yet ;)
<br><br>
<b>#define SCREENWIDTH ..</b><br><br>
I have found the coolest screen mode <i>ever</i> for playing doom in:
800x200! You cant actually set a screen mode that size, so you have to
put it in 800x600 and use the top 200 pixels of the screen only.
Try it - its cool!
<br><br>

<b>Coloured lighting!!!</b><br><br>
Hi. It's me again. Anyway, I've been doing not much work this week,
mainly because I suddenly decided to make a doom source port. So
I've been spending most of my free time on that. I've added translucency,
fixed some bugs etc. The main thing I
want to say, though, is: COLOURED LIGHTING! Yes, I have managed to
implement a crude form of coloured lighting in my port. I've not yet
released it, but you can have a look at the screen shots (sorry 'bout
the startan :)<br><br>
