<h1> SMMU news archive </h1>

These are the news pages from my website (my blog, essentially) while I
was writing SMMU. Many of the links may be broken.
Some of these are a bit juvenile in places - I was only 17!

<ul>
<li>
<a href="newsarc2.htm">1999-01-14 - 1999-02-19</a>:<br>
My first initial discussions about writing a Doom source port, including
screenshots of "sfdoom" (which was based on the Chi Hoang sources).
Before long I abandon this and restart my work based on MBF as well. I
appeal to the public for a name for the port and settle on SMMU.
The year on this page is listed as 1998 but I think this is a mistake.

<li>
<a href="newsarc3.htm">1999-03-20 - 1999-09-18</a>:<br>
First mentions of FraggleScript, and I make several SMMU releases.
I unintentionally start an argument with ZDoom author Randy Heit.

<li>
<a href="news.htm">1999-09-18 - 2000-04-17</a>:<br>
Linux port, hubs and netcode development. First release with FraggleScript
incorporated.


</ul>
