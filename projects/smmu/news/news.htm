<b>SMMU and all</b>
<br><br>
My A-Levels are coming up soon which means that I'll probably be
reducing the amount of time I spend with SMMU to get in some much-
needed revision. Anyway I've been doing loads and loads of stuff to
it recently. The networking engine is more or less finished I think,
all I need to do is include movement prediction and it should really
kick ass. 
<br><br>
And for all those of you that didnt believe me before, heres what I
said I'd do in my original list and how far I've got:

<ul>

<li> Client-Server <br>
	Yes. I can also compile a seperate dedicated server program which
	acts on its own. It uses the actual code from the port, so any
	changes I make there will take effect immediately
<li> Multiple communication channels <br>
	Done. Players can set up servers that listen for new connections
	using their serial port, using TCP/IP, <b>and</b> from old-style
	drivers like IPXSETUP/SERSETUP
<li> Inbuilt communication protocols <br>
	Done. Serial/Modem, UDP (TCP/IP) for internet/lan play
<li> Compatibility with old-style external program network
     drivers. <br>
	Yes. Includes ipxsetup and sersetup
<li> Inbuilt into game through menus<br>
	Menus are more-or-less done. No need for any messing with
	command lines.
<li> Compressed player packets for low bandwidth machines <br>
	Done.
<li> SMMUSERV for internet SMMU server lookup <br>
	Done. Check out 
     <a href="http://basrad.dhs.org/~fraggle">this</a>
<li> Server info retrieval <br>
	Done. You can query SMMUSERV for a list of running games on 
	the internet
<li> Original networking speedup features <br>
	ticdup etc. Done.
</ul>
I mentioned before that players will not be able to 'jump in' to
running netgames like in Quake. I have now 'loosened' this up a bit.
You can join servers that are running but cannot enter the game until
a change of level. Players that are waiting are able to chat in a
'waiting room' while they wait for the level to change. Also, when
you first start the game you can talk to other waiting players while
you wait for everyone to join.
<br><br>
Not bad, huh? I've also been adding the new Key Bindings system which
a few people were moaning about and that is basically finished as
well. The linux version is also now fully functional except for the
sound, which I hope to add now I have sound working in Linux on my
computer. In any case, the future looks bright!
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>More Progress</b>
<br><br>
The SMMU networking is coming along <u> very </u> nicely. It has already
had its first few tests over the internet against a few people. There
were some issues with Windows 98 and Winsock2 (as there was/is(?) in DOS 
Legacy originally) but I have found a solution to this now.

Heres some of the stuff done so far:

<ul>

<li> Built-in. You can start servers for internet play, or lan
     play, or over a serial link, or mix-n-match, and join them without
     having to quit the game. Menus are done for ease
     of use. No longer any need for the old command-line system that all
     the ports made so far have used.
<li> Start servers and watch the people join. You do not need to specify
     how many people you want there to be in a game. When you have enough
     people joined, you can start the game.
<li> Internet server lookup using
     <a href="http://basrad.dhs.org/~fraggle" target="_top">SMMUSERV</a>
     as already mentioned. When on the internet you can simply contact
     SMMUSERV and a list of all the games currently running appears,
     gamespy style.
</ul>

As I already mentioned, dynamic joining, "quake-style" will not be possible
but what I hoping to implement is a system where players can join and will
enter the game upon a change of level. Waiting players will hopefully be
able to talk with each other in a kind of "waiting room" while they wait
to enter the game. It's not as great as the networking you get with Quake
but if you consider the other benefits that I will be bringing I think
its a small price to play. Bear in mind that open-game joining is something
that Doom was simply never designed to do.

<br><br>

It seems I made a mistake in the previous update about 
<a href="http://netdoom.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">NetDoom</a>,
and ResDe will be joining me after all, although he will continue working
on NetDoom. I have no experience with windows programming, so ResDe should
be helping me by developing a windows version of SMMU.

<br><br>
<b>Progress</b>
<br><br>
I'm a little frustrated with the lack of response to my posting, i noticed
that no-one posted any comments in the doomworld comments thread. I'm also
angry that <a href="http://doomnation.com/afterglow/" target="_top">
Afterglow</a>, who I considered a friend and who in the past has always
been very supportive of SMMU (he made the SMMU start map) doubts my
abilities to code these new features to the extent
that he compares my port to some lamer's over-optimistic TC. In any case,
SMMU Networking is coming along extremely promisingly.
<br><br>
I noticed ResDe's announcement that he is to start work on
<a href="http://netdoom.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">NetDoom</a>,
and suggested to him that maybe we could combine our efforts.
ResDe is aiming for a true quake-like networking system which I think is
rather too much work (I wouldnt expect it to be at this level for quite
a while). In any case we both seem to be too unwilling to leave our own
ports so the proposed merger unfortunately seems unlikely.
<br><br>
BTW, check out this picture which is taken from a netgame running the
new SMMU networking code: <br>

<b>SMMU Networking</b>
<br><br>
Networking is what I'm currently working on in SMMU, as you may have
gathered. Anyway, I've started on a complete re-write of the
networking engine. Here are some of the features of the system
I'm playing with:

<ul>

<li> Client-Server <br>
   with possibility of dedicated server and seperate
   dedicated server program.
<li> Multiple communication channels <br>
   ie. can have different nodes connected to server via
       tcp/ip, serial/modem, ipx etc.
<li> Inbuilt communication protocols <br>
   No need to use old-style external programs. Inbuilt
   support for TCP/IP and Serial/Modem connections.
<li> Compatibility with old-style external program network
     drivers. <br>
     including ipxsetup and sersetup
<li> Inbuilt into game through menus<br>
     No more command line parameters. System allows someone
     to set up a server, wait for the other clients to
     join and then start the game, rather than specify how
     many clients are wanted.
<li> Compressed player packets for low bandwidth machines
<li> SMMUSERV for internet SMMU server lookup <br>
     already available - log into it
     <a href="telnet://basrad.dhs.org:52638">here</a> or
     <a href="http://basrad.dhs.org/~fraggle">view the
     stats</a>
<li> Server info retrieval <br>
     Ability to finger running servers to retrieve
     information eg. server name, status, number of
     clients etc.
<li> Original networking speedup features <br>
     ticdup etc.
</ul>

I do not plan to implement open joinable-games ala quake as
I think that there are too many issues to resolve to get doom
to network in this way. However, the final server structure
(as I envision it) may allow someone else to set up such a 
structure. <br> <br>

Clearly these are exciting prospects. However, I want you
to bear in mind that I have not yet written the code for this.
It is possible that I may not be able to get this network
structure to work at all, or that the end system will be
very different to the one outlined. On the other hand, I have
already had some encouraging success with what I have so far
written.

<br><br>
<b>smmuserv?</b>
<br><br>
Yeah, smmuserv, you heard.  smmuserv will be the central server for smmu
internet players who will be able to register their new servers or search
for existing servers. Anyway, basically I've written the program (which runs
under linux, of course :).  I've been trying it out on
<a href="http://basrad.dhs.org/~tom" target="_top">Mystican</a>'s box over
the past week or so, in fact it might even still be running, try
<a href="telnet://basrad.dhs.org:52638">here</a>.  All I have to do now is
the actual multiplayer in SMMU and this should really rock.
<br><br>

<p align="right"><img src="img/newsbox.gif" border="0"> <b>10 Feb 2000</b><img src="img/newsbox2.gif" border="0"></p>
<br><br>
<b>Suck my fucken cock asshole!</b>
<br><br>
I haven't done much work on SMMU recently... mostly been doing other
stuff like playing Opposing Force, although I have been doing some
network-related coding (not smmu network coding tho :).  Anyway I've 
managed to get a simple server-related program working which I've
been testing on myst's box. Speaking of which, remember to check out
<a href="http://basrad.dhs.org/~tom" target="_top">basrad</a>. <br>

<br><br>

<p align="right"><img src="img/newsbox.gif" border="0"> <b>23 Jan 2000</b><img src="img/newsbox2.gif" border="0"></p>
<br><br>
<b>Wait for it..</b>
<br><br>
Well, the time for the next release is getting closer. It should be here
in less than a week hopefully. Anyway, here are some new things to
dribble over:
<ul>
<li> File selector on the menu -- Basically, you can use the dynamic wad
     loading in SMMU more easily. The file selector displays a list of
     wad files and you simply select the one you want to load. Cool huh?
<li> FraggleScript functions for music -- now you can create jukeboxes
     in your levels or something, .. bah, i don't know. I think Recidivus
     was the one that suggested that one, the idea being that you can
     have sinister music changes to play on the atmosphere during the game.
<li> Of course, lots of bug fixes, this is the main point of this release.
     I also fixed the long-text-string-in-dos-format-dehacked-file-in-wad
     bug that was pissing me off :)
</ul>
Of course, once I release this version I'll be going on to other cool
stuff, namely multiplayer. It will rock, say no more :)

<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Features, anyone?</b>
<br><br>
I'm planning on doing another small release in a week or so, seeing as
FraggleScript dumbly seems to be missing some pretty basic stuff
(opening doors springs to mind :). Anyway as well as that it should
have some bug fixes from the previous version. Basically what I'm asking
for is if anyone wants any _little_ features for me to put in (ie.
FraggleScript functions etc) then <a href="mailto:fraggle@doomnation.com">
email me</a> so I can try and fit them into the next release.

<b>Santa fraggle</b>
<br><br>
Hi, it's santa fraggle here bringing you a little stocking-filler for
you to enjoy.. a new version of SMMU with a new menu and hubs support!
Get the DOS binaries <a href="download/smmu-bin-3_21.zip"> here </a>
or alternatively if you want to play with the sources or compile the
linux version, get the sources <a href="download/smmu-src-3_21.zip">
here </a>. Merry Christmas!
<br><br>

<b>SMMj00</b>
<br><br>
I thought I'd post <a href="img/news/sshot.gif">
a screenshot</a> of my computer. An exclusive screenshot of SMMU under
development.. or something. Heh is that pic schizophrenic. And before
you ask, no, I'm not <a href="http://www.doomnation.com/" target="_top">

<br><br>

<p align="right"><img src="img/newsbox.gif" border="0"> <b>9 Dec 99</b><img src="img/newsbox2.gif" border="0"></p>
<br><br>
<b>mmm.. hubs</b>
<br><br>
Well, hubs are almost done now, as is the menu. And I have to point out
that the menu is going to be a <i>bit</i> different from the
'traditional' menu. Featurewise, rather than in appearance, that is. 
Here are some of the interesting (or not) features of the new menu:
<ul>
<li> WAD loading menu making use of the dynamic wad loading
<li> Multiplayer menu allowing you to start serial/modem games and 
     (in the future) internet games
<li> 'Test framerate' option which compares your framerate during
     a timedemo of demo2 against the framerate of a fast computer
     (ie. mine)
<li> Demo playback menu
</ul>
<br><br>
So you can see, it has some interesting new options. This version of
SMMU is almost finished, I think. I'll 'polish' it and then get round
to releasing it in the not-too-distant future.

<br><br>
<p align="right"><img src="img/newsbox.gif" border="0"> <b>27 Nov 99</b><img src="img/newsbox2.gif" border="0"></p>
<br><br>
<b>Linux port</b>
<br><br>
I don't think I mentioned, but I'm doing a linux port of SMMU. Although
my linux skills are hardly good, I've already got a working svgalib
version. I'm currently using 'borrowed' code from cph's
<a href="http://lxdoom.linuxgames.com/" target="_top">lxdoom</a>.
The difference will be that instead of having 2 executables (which is
how all linux ports seem to have gone about the problem of having
the two display libraries of Xlib and svgalib) the linux port will have
only one.
<br><br>
<b> Other SMMU stuff</b>
<br><br>
Among other SMMU news (well, no one comes here for anything else :)
there is the news that I have started on hubs and have also got a
significant way into rewriting the menu. I'm still waiting for Satori
to do me the SMMU graphics but 
<a href="mailto:umkiddel@cc.UManitoba.CA">Dave Kiddell</a> has sent me
a new title for the text file.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Stuff</b><br><br>
Don't those banners just make you feel crushed? Well go there and buy
whatever they want or something, i dunno. Anyway due to popular demand
I have for you <a href="download/add_fs.zip">this</a> automatic
program to load FraggleScript into wads, go check.

<b>Doomnation</b><br><br>
Well, I finally decided to move to a real website hosting rather than that old xoomcrap. So here I am in

<br><br>
<b>Hmm?</b><br><br>
Well, what a great response to my release of SMMU. I haven't had
<b>ONE</b> email about it since its release. However, it must have
gained some attention as there are now two sites devoted to it and
FraggleScript. I've also heard that <a href="mailto:haleyjd@okstate.edu">
Quasar</a> is adding FraggleScript to his port eternity which will no doubt
go somewhere toward increasing FraggleScript's popularity. The two
tutorial sites are:
<ul>
<li> <a href = "http://smmuediting.cjb.net"> SMMU tutorials (Thomas Sturn)</a>
	which also includes a port of FraggleScript to win32 and discusses
	the possibility of a win32 port of SMMU itself
<li> <a href = "http://smmu.frad.org/"> SMMU tutorials (prower)</a>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b> Other pointless SMMU stuff</b><br><br>
I have started working on the SMMU menu. I have abandoned the idea
I previously mentioned (see previous update). I am instead adopting
a more boom-style look. However the code is very generalised so it
should be easy to change the look if neccesary. I am, however, 
reorganising the menu, especially the options menu which has been
split into several categories (it may be possible to have a 'classic
option' to restore this if there is enough demand)
<br><br>
<b> Other pointless non-SMMU stuff </b><br><br>

<b>SMMU woo!</b><br><br>
If you've been attentive over the past few weeks you'll probably have
noticed rumours of SMMU and FraggleScript floating around, not least
of which was <a href="http://prower.frad.org/" target="_top">prower</a>'s 
claim that it "owns his llama ass". Hmm. Anyway, I decided this is
probably just about stable enough to release right now, so you can get
it <a href="download/smmu.zip">here</a> (or the
<a href="download/smmu-src.zip"> sources</a> of course).<br>
This version contains already quite extensive FraggleScript ability
already, although there are a few things i still need to do (doors
for example :). Suffice to say it'll all be coming soon.<br>
I want as much feedback as possible! The only bug that I currently
know of is that the <b>idbeholda</b> cheat isn't work. Other than
that, let me know!

<br><br>
<b>Whats with the menu?</b><br><br>
If you download the above beta, you should probably notice that the
menus are quite behind the rest of the game. The only way to set some
options is by the console. I am planning a major menu re-write: I have
an idea for a quite radical menu re-think although one that I think
could be rather cool. There is a text file describing the proposed
change <a href="new-menu.txt">here</a>. I originally designed the file
for Satori to describe the new graphics i wanted but when I took
another look at what I'd thought up, I reckoned it was probably a
good idea to see what other people thought first. Anyway,
<a href="mailto:sfraggle@sfrag.free-online.co.uk">let me know</a>
if my idea is great(in which case I'll use it) or if it sucks(in which
case I'll choose a more 'traditional' style).

<p align="right"><img src="img/newsbox.gif" border="0"> <b>18 Sep 99</b> <img src="img/newsbox2.gif" border="0"></p>
<br><br>
<b>Clean slate</b><br><br>
I've archived all the old news: Notepad was running out of memory on 
the news file =). Anyway the most important thing I have to say is
FRAGGLESCRIPT! Yes, I have started adding FraggleScript into SMMU
and its almost finished I have to say. I just have a few minor things
to add to the language itself and then add all the functions to it.
Anyway I'm not going to release the actual version of SMMU containing
it for a week or so, but you can download the <a href="img/news/start.fs">
Level file</a> for the testbed level I'm using to develop and test it.
I'm sure you'll agree it can already do some quite impressive stuff =).
<br><br>
<b>WADPTR stuff</b>
<br><br>
btw i forgot to mention <a href=
"http://www.forwiss.tu-muenchen.de/~dehmel/DIY.html#wadptr">Andreas'
Dehmel's website</a> where he's got versions of wadptr for sun, RISC-OS,
etc. He's also done a bit more work on the source to make it faster,
although I tested it under dos and it didnt work properly. I'll
release the new sources and binaries once its stable again.
