<h1> SMMU </h1>

<body>

SMMU is a new Doom port based on Lee Killough's MBF, which is based on BOOM,
which is based on DOSDOOM, which is based on the original LinuxDoom sources
released by John Carmack.
<br>
<br>

<i>
 "i suggest you all check out his MBF mod. it's one of the few
 mods that is actually done right, adding features instead of gloss, adding power instead of
 candy to sell his idea."

I think this quote describes well what I'm trying to do with SMMU. Here is a
list of features I've added/am adding to SMMU. Please note that some of
these features are still under development, although others can be found
in the current version of SMMU available from
<a href="http://fraggle.tsx.org/"> my homepage </a>

    <h3> Inbuilt multiplayer </h3>
        Many doom ports, such as Zdoom, Legacy, prdoom and so on have
	built-in network game support. However, these all use the
	'traditional' system of external network drivers and command
	lines. If you want to start a new game then you have to quit
	and restart. <br>
	SMMU includes built-in serial/modem support which can be
	started	<i>inside</i> the game without a need to restart. 
	The currently released version of SMMU includes this, although
	the new version adds easy support for it using the menu. <br>
	You can also expect TCP/IP games in the near future using a
	similar system. I will be aiming for a 'descent-style' approach
	rather than 'quake-style': that is, the server computer starts
	ands sees a list of people who have joined. When he/she is
	satisfied with the number of players joining, he can start the
	game. I feel that a quake-style system of game-joining would
	be too difficult to implement and even if I managed to achieve
	it, as a result unreliable.

    <h3>'FraggleScript' Scripting </h3> 
	One of the many demands high on people in the doom community's
	wish-list is for scripting in levels. This allows level authors
	to write small programs and attach them to their levels, which
	can be activated by the player doing certain things in the
	level. <br>
	SMMU adds the much-famed 'FraggleScript' which is a
	fully-featured programming language. Unlike other languages
	such as the ACS language used by Zdoom, FraggleScript does not
	need to be compiled. It can be simply dropped into a level and
	will work fine. Two sites dedicated to FraggleScript editing
	have recently appeared <a href="http://smmuediting.cjb.net/"> here</a>
	and <a href="http://smmu.frad.org/"> here </a> for more
	information.

    <h3> Legacy skins support </h3> 
	The Doom Legacy team added support for skins replacement in
	their port, which allows custom wad files to be loaded with
	replacement sprites for the player. SMMU includes support for
	Legacy skins. Multiplayer is sure to be more interesting as
	players turn themselves into imps, duke nukems, lost souls and
	other strange creatures. So if you've ever wanted to become a
	black floating skull, you came to the right port!

    <h3>Coloured lighting</h3> 
	Boom added support for colormapped levels - that is, areas of
	the level shaded a different color. However, in boom you
	saw the whole level in the color of the area you were
	standing in. SMMU takes it one step further and allows you to
	see all the parts of the level in the color they should be.
	So effects such as coloured lighting are possible.

	the field of view so that you can zoom in on far away objects.

    <h3> Totally Rewritten menu </h3> 
	One of the things I noticed about the various ports is that
	although they all changed the doom menu to an extent, they
	still retained the old code for it. I have started on a
	complete re-write of the menu. The new, much simplified code
	structure allows me to add a host of new menus to allow access
	to the new SMMU features (multiplayer especially). <br>
	Doom conservatives, don't worry, though. SMMU retains the
	original main menu of new, options, load, save, quit, although
	it adds a new menu 'features' which allows access to multiplayer
	and demo options. And
	although it includes new 'full-screen' small-text menus, I
	have tried my best to do them in a 'doom-style'. <br>
	One thing I have done is to re-organise the options
	menu and divide it into various categories, meaning you
	can find the option you need much quicker.

    <h3> Rewritten HUD </h3> 
        I thought it was time to rewrite the HUD code. The new HUD includes
        a similar full-screen HUD to the one in Boom, but with longer names
        so you can see more clearly what each item represents. There is also
        a choice of three different styles. <br>
        SMMU allows you to choose from two different crosshairs. There are
        'smart' crosshairs like the ones in half-life: they light up when
        pointed at an enemy so you can see when its ready to fire. <br>
        For netgames there is an optional frag display which displays the
        names of all the players in the game in descending order of ranking.

    <h3>Full original doom/boom compatibility</h3> 
	I have done my best when adding new gameplay features to
	retain original doom and boom compatibility. SMMU should play
	back the majority of demos correctly, and all levels should be
	loaded correctly. As it is an MBF-derived port, it includes
        support for all the boom and MBF editing features. <br>
        I would like to think that SMMU is a bit more of a 'conservative'
        port than some of the other ports currently available. There are
        a lot of ports which simply try to make Doom into Quake. This isn't
        my intention. I concede that SMMU includes some new features which
        are Quake-inspired, but I try to make sure that these can be
        disabled or are hidden unless the player specifically wants to
        see them.

    <h3>Demo walkcam</h3> 
	The demo walkcam allows you, during demo playback, to walk
	around inside the demo as it plays, or even to pause the demo
	and take screenshots from various positions. The screen shot
	given on the left shows a scene from a paused demo shown at
	three different angles. The walkcam allows you to take the kind
	of pictures that have never been seen before.

    <h3>Chasecam</h3>
	The chasecam is another camera. When activated, the chasecam
	follows you around the level 'tomb-raider style'. SMMU also
	includes a 'cooldemo' option which when activated will during
	demo playback give
	random viewpoints from different players, the chasecam or
	cameras placed in the level by the level author.

    <h3>Console</h3> 
        SMMU includes its own command-console where you can type commands,
        change the level, send network messages, change game variables,
        and so on. It includes all of the features you expect in game
        consoles, including scrolling, tab-completion, delayed commands,
        and command aliases. <br>
        I work under the belief that if you don't want to see the console,
        you shouldn't have to. That is, unless you push the console button,
        the console won't appear. The exception in this is for netgames,
        where the console is important to see network messages. Although
        SMMU defaults to showing the startup messages in the console window,
        this can be disabled easily from the menu if you so wish.

    <h3>Start map</h3>
        Yes, I know. It's a Quake feature. Top level editor
        <a href="mailto:derekmd@doomnation.com">Afterglow</a>
        is creating the SMMU start map which will replace the traditional
        skill level menu. You can expect it to include new SMMU features
        such as coloured lighting and FraggleScript scripting. And of course,
        it'll be totally disable-able for traditionalists who wish to use the
        menu.

    <h3>'Swirling' floors</h3>
        Another Quake-style feature. Rather than the usual animated floors,
        level authors can choose to use a new 'swirling water' effect on
        liquid floor textures. This can be hack-tested on all animated flats
        from the console variable r_swirl.

<h3> Coming soon ... </h3>

<ul>
	<li> <b> Hubs </b> <br>
                Hubs are when you have a group of levels, with links that
                allow you to travel between them. You may have seen this
                kind of feature if you have played Hexen, Half life or
                certain Zdoom maps.
	<li> <b> Linux SMMU</b> <br>
                I have already started on this. I have a working version
                already which lets you play SMMU using SVGALIB. The code has
                been modified to allow multi-platform support. When finished
                you can expect an X-window version also. I am using code
                from lxdoom by Colin Phipps, who might also help me out in
                Linux (I'm a real Linux newbie, suprised I've got this far
                to tell the truth :)
	<li> <b> TCP/IP Internet play </b> <br>
                TCP/IP gaming (internet gaming) is a likely feature I will be adding in the
                not-too-distant future.
                As already discussed, this will be built-in and be startable
                from within the game. I have already started experimenting
                with networking (seperately from the game) and have had some
                reasonable success already. The network library I am using
                is a DOS version of the standard BSD sockets which is used
                in Linux and Windows, so porting to different platforms
                should be reasonably easy.
