<h1> Text Mode Doom </h1>

One of the features of <a href="../">SMMU</a> is its text mode rendering
feature.
I used to have a different page here with
some decent pictures but unfortunately it got lost. I took these 
pictures with my digital camera so the quality isnt too good unfortunately:

<ul>

<li> <a href="0276_-_titlescreen.jpg">Doom II Titlescreen</a>
<li> <a href="0279_-_imp.jpg">An Imp</a>
<li> <a href="0281_-_hires.jpg">80x50 mode</a> is a bit clearer than
     <a href="0282_-_lores.jpg">80x25 mode</a>
<li> Some of the monsters come out better than others. 
     This <a href="0283_-_demon.jpg">demon</a> is quite nice for example.
<li> <a href="0284_-_romero.jpg">To win the game you must kill me..</a>
</ul>

<b> New! </b> A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s15eJ9WMfVg">video
of SMMU in text mode</a> is available on Youtube. It can be viewed below.

<h2> FAQ </h2>

<ol>
<li> 
<b> What? </b> <br>
This is Doom running in DOS text mode.
<li> 
<b> You mean like aalib? </b> <br>
Well, not really. Aalib uses normal ascii characters. This uses the 
extended ascii mode "gradient" characters. Also, aalib is mono only.
This is in colour.
<li>
<b> How does it work? </b> <br>
The engine renders into a 320x200 internal buffer like it would 
normally. This then gets converted into either an 80x25 or 
80x50 text mode display. The text colour is selected based on the
hue of the colour (text mode has 16 different colours) and the
gradient character to use is selected from the lightness value.
<li>
<b> How can I play this? </b> <br>
First download <a href="../">SMMU</a>. 
You need to use the DOS version, though. Then run like this: 
<blockquote>
<tt>smmu -textmode</tt>
</blockquote>
</ol>

<b> WARNING </b> : The characters on the text mode screen have a tendency to
blink and flash a lot. I have managed to give myself a headache after
playing for a while. If you are epileptic or have some other condition where
you may be affected by this then do _not_ play it. At the same time, you use
this at your own risk. If you have a fit and die after playing my port, it's
not my fault.
