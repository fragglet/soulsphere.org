<p>I underestimated the complexity of the remainder of the tutorials, so I only have the <a href="tutrand.html">Random Thing Generator</a> tutorial up at this point.  It's pretty cool though, it includes some theoretical probability in it (10% of the time a soul sphere is spawned, 40% a medikit, etc.) which is something I haven't seen in a Doom level before.</p>

<p>Yeesh, twice in one day.  With a bit of sleep in between updates. <tt>:)</tt>  The new tutorial is rather short, called <a href="tutmess.html">The Infamous Message</a>.  Also up are the <a href="basic.html">Basic Function List/Syntax</a> and the <a href="linedef.html">SMMU Linedef Trigger Types</a>.  I realize there are a bunch of sections undone, and I hope to have at least two more tutorials up by the end of the day.  Stay tuned, or something.</p>

<p>There's an immense tutorial up, called "Basic Script Implementation", under the (duh) tutorials section.  If there are any mistakes, forgive me - I spent about two hours writing it/making screenshots for it, making it precise as possible, and it's 1am at this point.  Also, the "Fragglescript Syntax Rules" and "Complete Function List" sections are up.  Expect the remaining sections to be done the rest of this weekend, hopefully.</p>

<p>Special thanks to three people: <a href="http://members.xoom.com/cybspage/">Cyb</a>, who pimped the two graphics you see on these pages; <a href="http://www2.crosswinds.net/~tsturm/smmu/">Thomas Sturm</a>, who linked me on his page, and Quido666, for help with use of Edmap.</p>
