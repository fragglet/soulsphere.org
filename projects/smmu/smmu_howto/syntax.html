<center><i>Note: This deals with the syntax rules of Fragglescript exclusively.  For information on how to junction scripts with levels, see <a href="tutbasic.html">Basic Script Implementation</a>.</i></center><br>
<br>


<p>As it is with any programming language, FraggleScript has its own syntactic rules that coders need to follow, otherwise they'll hear the dreaded player death sound as their script starts to run.</p>

<p>Not unlike C, C++, or Pascal, functions in FraggleScript (from this point on, called FS) need to end with a semicolon.</p>


<br>
<br>
<tt>
<blockquote>
rnd();<br>
tip("Word up!");<br>
playername();<br>
</blockquote></tt>
<br>
<br>


<p>Unlike other programming languages, however, FS seperates lists and series by commas instead of semicolons.</p>


<br>
<br>
<tt><blockquote>
for(i=0, i<10, i++);<br>
int i, j, k;<br>
</blockquote></tt>
<br>
<br>


<p>Got it?  Hopefully you do.  To set off where scripts start and end, use brackets.</p>


<br>
<br>
<tt><blockquote>
script 0<br>
  {<br>
     tip("Hi everybody!");<br>
     wait(100);<br>
     tip("Hi Doctor Nick!");<br>
  }<br>
</tt></blockquote>
<br>
<br>


<p>Want everyone to see your sharp wit when they look at your code?  Well, that's the joy of comments.  Comments can be set off by lines beginning with ;, or anything preceding in a line after //.</p>


<br>
<br>
<tt><blockquote>
script 0<br>
;This is script 0<br>
  {<br>
    tip("Hi, everybody!");<br>
    wait(100);   // Wait 100 tics<br>
    tip("Hi, Doctor Nick!");  // This is a quote from the Simpsons<br>
  }<br>
;That was Script 0<br>
</blockquote></tt>
