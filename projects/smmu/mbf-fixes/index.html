<h1> MBF fixes </h1>

This is a fixed-up version of the source code to
<a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF">Marine's Best Friend</a>,
that includes:
<ul>
<li> License change to the GPL (the last version of MBF was released
     before the Doom source was relicensed under the GPL.
<li> Some bug fixes
<li> Compilation fixed under later versions of Allegro.
</ul>

The full change history is <a href="mbf-fixes-log.html">here</a>.
You can also browse it <a href="http://github.com/fragglet/mbf">on GitHub</a>.
<p>
Note that I made these changes almost 8 years ago from the time of 
writing (2009), so this may still not compile with current versions
of DJGPP/Allegro.  I haven't tried.
<p>
Compare and contrast with <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/eternity/">
WinMBF</a>.
