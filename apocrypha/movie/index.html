<h1> That time I got my online handle into a Hollywood movie script </h1>

Back in 2004 I was a nerd finishing up the last year of my degree. My primary
nerd obsession was and remains the <a href="http://doomwiki.org/">Doom</a>
series of games. Out of the blue I received a message from a stranger on my
AOL instant messenger account (remember those?):

<blockquote>
<b>dave callaham</b>: Can I ask you a DOOM question <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: sorry to bother you <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: ok <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: This is going to come off strange but it’s legit <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: I am writing the DOOM movie for Warner Bros <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: I need help with a scene <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: I never played multiplayer and I need help with a line of
dialoguie <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: would you help me with that? <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: sounds rather unbelievable :)
</blockquote>

I’m understandably skeptical when people come to me making bold claims which
could turn out to be elaborate pranks. But he continued:

<blockquote>
<b>dave callaham</b>: I know <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: hold on <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: rwad this <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: this was in Variety this morning <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: it’s an article about a pitch I just sold to Universal
<br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: jusst go to the bottom <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: After getting Universal to the altar with an overall deal
following “American Wedding,” Adam Herz has made his first project purchase.
Dave Callaham has been set to write an untitled thriller for Herz, who has
named his U-based company Terra Firma Films.
</blockquote>

Callaham’s first spec, “Horesemen,” was bought by Focus for Radar and Platinum
Dunes to produce. He’s scripting “Doom” at Warner Bros. for producers John
Wells and Lorenzo di Bonaventura, and has a blind script deal at WB to follow.
U’s Mary Parent and Damien Saccani will supervise the space-station thriller.

<blockquote>
<b>dave callaham</b>: If you’re not convinced I understand i will ask someone else <br>
</blockquote>

You can read the article <a
href="https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/herz-tunes-in-to-pic-for-terra-firm-films-1117902251/">here</a>
along with Dave’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Callaham">Wikipedia article</a>.
Despite still remaining skeptical, I was aware that a Doom movie <a
href="https://www.doomworld.com/vb/doomworld-news/10213-the-doom-movie-for-real-this-time/">was
supposedly in production</a>, although <a
href="https://www.doomworld.com/vb/doomworld-news/17071-latest-doom-movie-crap/">news
was spurious</a> and it was unclear what the status of
its development was.
<p>
Dave had got my contact details from the <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/">Doomworld forums</a>. It seems that he had
already tried to get help from other fans, but everyone else was similarly
skeptical, and he was up against a deadline:

<blockquote>
<b>dave callaham</b>: I just need help for five minutes <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: ok sure <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: no one will help or believe me, and I have to have this
draft in tonight for the budget meeting tomorrow <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: worst case you help me and nothing happens and you lose
two minutes <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: best case <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: you just wrote a line for the DOOM movie <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: so can i run this thing by you? <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: ok <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: go ahead
</blockquote>

If I was unsure why a Hollywood scriptwriter needed my assistance, things
subsequently became clearer:

<blockquote>
<b>dave callaham</b>: Two people in a room playing muliplayer doom against each
other <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: scene is sort of an inside joke <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: one of them is about to get whacked <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: all I need <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: whacked? <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: eaten <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: fragged? <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: no i mean in real life a demon is about to eat him <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: ah <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: he’s a charcter in the movie playing the game
</blockquote>

Some of the people who I’ve told this story have found the premise cliched.
They’re probably right, but it’s hard to do much that’s truly original in an
action movie, least of all one based on a video game. Personally I think it’s
nice that he wanted to include a nod to the original games, which at this point
were already over 10 years old and firmly ingrained in people’s nostalgia for
the past.
<p>
Dave wanted to know what someone might say when playing <a
href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Multiplayer#Deathmatch">deathmatch</a>. We
bounced a bunch of ideas around and some of them couldn’t be used: it couldn’t
reference <a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/BFG_9000">the BFG</a> since that
was a big reveal at the end of the movie. But we eventually decided the <a
href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chaingun">chaingun</a> was a more acceptable
substitute and came up with something that worked for him:

<blockquote>
<b>fraggle</b>: standing around is usually a bad thing to do <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: the chaingun iss clean <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: I ddon’t use the chaingun so if you can say somethign
about that it would work <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: like you want to move around a lot so you dont get hit <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: so standing around shooting someone with a chaingun would be
pretty dumb <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: ok <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: so <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: “I’m up 5 frags on this guy and he just keeps standing
there taking shots with the chaingun”
</blockquote>

And then:

<blockquote>
<b>dave callaham</b>: do you play with a handle or something <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: like a name &gt; <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: fraggle <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: i will try to drop it in iff you want <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: “I’m up on this guy Fraggle…” <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: then you’ll be the one getting your ass beat though <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: but I’dd be happy to try it <br>
<b>dave callaham</b>: if you want <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: haha <br>
<b>fraggle</b>: that would be way cool :)
</blockquote>

I later realised that <i>fraggle</i> might be trademarked and therefore
problematic, so I suggested he use my alternate handle of <i>fragglet</i>
instead. And then for the next year and a half I was left wondering: was this
all some kind of lame prank? Am I going to be a minor star in a Hollywood
movie? Are people going to watch the moving and then be asking me how the heck
I pulled that off?
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%28film%29"><em>Doom</em></a> was
released in October 2005, starring Karl Urban (better known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89omer">Éomer</a> from <i>Lord of the
Rings</i>) and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. It was a terrible film.

My line didn’t make it to the movie. But a couple of years later the original
script surfaced which did contain it. You can read it
<a href="http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Doom.pdf">here</a>. The reactions
to this version were “not positive” either. But perhaps the movie as released
had left a sour taste in peoples’ mouths.

<img class="illustration" src="the-chaingun.png" width="70%">

Dave got a lot of criticism for how he wrote the film. Doom’s original (albeit
paper-thin) plot is about demons invading a military base on a Martian moon —
originally envisioned as a cross between <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28film%29">Alien</a> and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Dead_%28franchise%29">Evil Dead</a>
series. The movie changed it to a plot involving genetic experiments gone wrong
— Doom’s iconic demons weren’t even demons any more!
<p>
But maybe he got more criticism than he deserved. In an <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041231022053/http://www.homelanfed.com/index.php?id=28042">open
letter</a> to Doom fans published before the film was even released, he tried
to defend his work and explain that he had tried to stay true to the original
games:
<p>
<blockquote>
I am the only person involved creatively who has ever made any attempt to open
discourse with the game’s internet fanbase, and I am the only person involved
who has continually kept the ideals of the game first and foremost in mind. I
very truthfully believe that my unapologetic and hyper-violent script would
have been a Doom fan’s movie dream come true. However, since my involvement,
the film has steadily moved away from the realm of fandom and more toward the
realm of traditional Hollywood interests.
</blockquote>

Who knows what Dave’s vision of the Doom movie could have been like? There are
very few movies based on video games that have ever turned out to be any good.
But maybe that’s the point. Game adaptations are money-making schemes —
exploiting the infamy of a franchise in one space to make money in another. Who
in that situation wants to try anything risky or original? There’s a job to be
done, a movie to deliver, and tickets to be sold.

But it would would have been cool to have been immortalized as the dork with
the chaingun.
