<h1> Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) and its use in 3-D Rendering </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>
One of the biggest problems facing designers of 3-D rendering engines
is that of visibility calculation: only visible walls and objects must
be drawn, and they must be drawn in the right order (close walls
should be drawn in front of far away walls). More importantly, for
applications such as games it is important to develop algorithms which
allow a scene to be rendered quickly. As a result, a number of
approaches to the visibility calculation problem now exist.
</p>

<p>
Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) is a technique which can be used to
greatly speed up visibility calculations in 3D Rendering. It has been
used by several famous games, such as <i>Doom</i> and
<i>Quake</i>. 
</p>

<p>
I use several terms which may need explaining:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Map</i> - this refers to the area being rendered: in a game
this is the game Map or Level.
<li> <i>Viewpoint</i> - the point of view at which we are rendering
<li> <i>Field of view</i> - the area of the map visible from the
     position and angle of the viewpoint
</ul>

<p>
I will explain the system using the examples of a 2-D Map of the kind
<i>Doom</i> uses. However, BSP can easily be extended to 3 dimensions
(or more?) - instead of 2-D lines, 3-D planes would be used, etc.

<h3> Precomputed calculations </h3>

<p>
Before the map can be rendered we must perform a number of
calculations on it.  However, once these calculations are performed
their results can be used many times.  This is one of the advantages
of BSP - once the calculations are performed they do not need to be
done again, unless the map is changed - BSP only allows 'static' maps,
or ones that do not move. If a map has any moving parts then they must
be rendered seperately. 
</p>

<p>
What must be done is to partition, or divide up, the map into convex
polygons. A convex polygon is a polygon where all internal angles are
less than or equal to 180 degrees. The following shapes are convex
polygons, for example:
</p>

<img class="illustration" src="convex1.png">

<p>
The following shapes are not convex, however:
</p>

<img class="illustration" src="convex2.png">

<p>
If the map is considered as a non-convex polygon, we can divide this
into two sub-polygons by drawing a dividing line across it. For
example, consider the following map:
</p>

<img class="illustration" src="division.png">

<p>
In dividing this polygon in two, we have created two
"sub-polygons". This division can be represented by a simple tree:
</p>

<img class="illustration" src="tree1.png">

<p>
It is now possible to recursively divide each of the two
sub-polygons. Each division produces a new "branch" to the
tree. Recursion continues until the map is divided into convex
polygons, which are the "leaves" of the tree.
</p>

<img class="illustration" src="division2.png">

<p>
For reasons which will become apparent, it is desirable to keep the
tree 'balanced' if possible: that is, to keep the heights of either
sides of the tree roughly equal. 
</p>

<h3> Rendering </h3>

<p>
Rendering using BSP trees is also done using a recursive
algorithm. The most common approach is to start at the root node (the
top of the tree) and work down recursively.  This is why it is
desirable to keep the tree balanced: this reduces the amount of
recursion done.  Recursion to large depths could significantly slow
down rendering.
</p>

<p>
The core of the visibility ordering system lies in the order in which
the rendering function recurses. That is, whether the left or right
subtree of the given node is rendered first. For any particular node,
there is a dividing line where it splits into two subnodes. If
this line is extended to infinity, the viewpoint from which we are
rendering can be considered to be on either the 'left' or 'right'
side. The side the viewpoint is on determines which of the subnodes is
rendered first.
</p>

<img class="illustration" src="render1.png" border=0>

<p>
Note that there are actually two ways in which rendering can be
performed: 

<ul>

<li> <b> Back-to-front </b> <br>
     In a back to front renderer, far away walls are rendered first
     and are obscured by closer walls. This is the system used in the
     diagram above. The disadvantage of back-to-front rendering is one
     of overdraw - parts of walls are drawn which are obscured by
     closer ones and are not seen. This is unneccesary overhead.

<li> <b> Front-to-back </b> <br>
     A front to back renderer works in the opposite way: closer walls
     are rendered first, and walls further away are clipped against
     the walls already drawn. Because it has no overdraw, almost all
     practical BSP renderers use a front-to-back method. 

</ul>

</p>

<p>

Some example pseudo code for a simple back-to-front renderer would
therefore be:

<pre>
function render(node)
{
  if this node is a leaf
    {
      draw this node to the screen
    }
  else
    {
      determine which side of the dividing line the viewpoint is
      
      if it is on the left side
        {
          render(right subnode)
          render(left subnode)
        }
      else
        {
          render(left subnode)
          render(right subnode)
        }
    }
}
</pre>

</p>

<p>
The main disadvantage of bsp trees is that the entire map must be
static (non-moving) - if part of it moved, the entire tree would have
to be rebuilt. One way to overcome this problem is to keep static and
moving parts seperate, and render them seperately.
</p>

<h3> Other uses of BSP Trees </h3>

<p>
As well as in visibility ordering, BSP trees also have a number of
other uses. One of these is the fact that dividing up the map in a
hierarchical way such as this allows large portions of the map to be
excluded from the rendering process - if all of a particular node is
outside the field of view of the viewpoint, that node can be discarded
from rendering. This is a fast and effective way of speeding up the
rendering engine.
</p>

<p>
The tree can also be used for a number of other effects, such as
shadows.
