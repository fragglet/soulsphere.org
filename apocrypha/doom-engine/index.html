<p>
The Doom rendering engine is an interesting study in software rendering.
It is not a true &ldquo;3D&rdquo; engine (as it is not possible look up
and down properly), but is however a fairly elegant system that allows
pseudo-3D rendering. In its time, Doom was revolutionary and almost
unique in its providing a fast texture-mapped 3D environment.

<h2>Doom level structure</h2>
<p>
Viewed from the top down, all Doom levels are really 2D, demonstrating
one of the key limitations of the Doom engine: it is not possible to
have &ldquo;rooms above rooms&rdquo;.
<p>
The base unit is the vertex, which represents a single 2D point.
Vertices (or &ldquo;vertexes&rdquo; as they are referred to internally)
are then joined to form lines, known as &ldquo;linedefs&rdquo;. Each
linedef can have either one or two sides, these are known as
&ldquo;sidedefs&rdquo;. Sidedefs are then grouped together to form
polygons; these are called &ldquo;sectors&rdquo;. Sectors represent
particular areas of the level.
<p>
Each sector contains a number of properties: a floor height, ceiling
height, light level, a floor texture and a ceiling texture. To have a
different light level in a particular area, for example, a new sector
must be created for that area with a different light level. One-sided
linedefs therefore represent solid &ldquo;walls&rdquo;, while two-sided
linedefs represent &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; lines between sectors.
<p>
Sidedefs are used to store wall textures; these are totally separate
from the floor and ceiling textures. Each sidedef can have three
textures; these are called the middle, upper and lower textures. In
one-sided linedefs, only the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; texture is used for
the texture on the wall. In two-sided linedefs, the situation is more
complex. The lower and upper textures are used to fill the gaps where
adjacent sectors have different floor and ceiling heights: lower
textures are used for steps, for example. The sidedefs can have a middle
texture as well, although most do not; this is used to make textures
&ldquo;hang&rdquo; in mid air. For example, when a transparent bar
texture is seen forming a cage, this is an example of a middle texture
on a two-sided linedef.
<p>
Finally, there is a list of objects in the level; objects are known as
&ldquo;things&rdquo; by Doom. These are used to place players, monsters,
powerups, etc. Each thing is given a 2D coordinate, as with the
vertices. Things are then automatically placed on the floor or the
ceiling depending on their type.
<p>
This is only an overview of the basic structure of Doom levels; most of
the data structures here carry extra properties, for example, texture
offsets, and special properties for gameplay. These are omitted here as
they are not particularly relevant to this discussion.

<h2>BSP</h2>

<p>
Doom makes use of a system known as Binary Space Partitioning (BSP). A
tool is used to generate the BSP data for a level beforehand. Depending
on the size of the level, this process can take quite some time. It is
because of this that it is not possible to move the walls in Doom; while
doors and lifts move up and down, none of them ever move sideways.
<p>
The level is divided up into a binary tree: each location in the tree is
a &ldquo;node&rdquo; which represents a particular area of the level
(with the root node representing the entire level). At each branch of
the tree there is a dividing line which divides the area of the node
into two subnodes. At the same time, the dividing line divides linedefs
into line segments called &ldquo;segs&rdquo;.
<p>
At the leaves of the tree are convex polygons, where it is not useful to
divide the level up any further. These convex polygons are called
&ldquo;ssectors&rdquo; (subsectors), and are bound to a particular
sector. Each ssector has an associated list of segs associated with it.

<p>
The BSP system is really a very clever way of sorting the ssectors into
the right order for rendering. The algorithm is fairly simple:
<ul>
<li> Start at the root node.
<li> Draw the child nodes of this node recursively. The child node
closest to the camera is drawn first. This can be found from looking at
which side of the node's dividing line the camera is on.
<li> When an ssector is reached, draw it.
</ul>
<p>
In this way, it is possible to always draw the far away ssectors before
the close up ones. It is also possible to exclude large parts of the
level which cannot be seen: each node has a 2D bounding box. If that
bounding box is totally outside the field of view, it is not drawn.

<h2> Drawing the walls </h2>

<p>
All walls in Doom are drawn vertically; it is because of this that it is
not possible to properly look up and down. It is possible to perform a
form of look up/down via &ldquo;y-shearing&rdquo;, and many modern Doom
source ports do this. Essentially this works by increasing the vertical
resolution, and then providing a &ldquo;window&rdquo; on that space. By
moving the window up and down, it is possible to give the illusion of
looking up and down. However, this tends to distort the view the
further up and down the player looks.
<p>
The Doom engine renders the walls as it traverses the BSP tree, drawing
ssectors by order of distance from the camera so that the closest segs
are drawn first. As the segs are drawn, they are stored in a linked
list. This is used to clip other segs rendered later on, reducing
overdraw. This is also used later to clip the edges of sprites.
<p>
Once the engine reaches a solid (1-sided) wall at a particular x
ordinate, no more lines need to be drawn at that area. For clipping the
engine stores a &ldquo;map&rdquo; of areas of the screen where solid
walls have been reached. This allows far away parts of the level which
are invisible to the player to be clipped completely.
<p>
The Doom graphic format stores the wall textures as sets of vertical
columns; this is useful to the renderer, which essentially renders the
walls by drawing lots of vertical columns of texture.

<h2> Floor and Ceiling </h2>

<p>
The system for drawing floors and ceilings (&ldquo;flats&rdquo;) is less
elegant than that used for the walls. Flats are drawn with a flood-fill
like algorithm. Because of this, it is sometimes possible if a bad BSP
builder is used to get &ldquo;holes&rdquo; where the floor or ceiling
bleeds down to the edges of the screen. This is also the reason that if
the player travels outside of the level using the noclip cheat, the
floors and ceilings appear to stretch out from the level over the empty
space.
<p>
The floor and ceiling are drawn as &ldquo;visplanes&rdquo;. These represent
horizontal runs of texture, from a floor or ceiling at a particular
height, light level and texture (if two adjacent sectors have the exact
same floor, these can get merged into one visplane). Each x position in
the visplane has a particular vertical line of texture which is to be
drawn.
<p>
Because of this limit of drawing one vertical line at each x position,
it is sometimes necessary to split visplanes into multiple visplanes.
For example, consider viewing a floor with two concentric squares. The
inner square will vertically divide the surrounding floor. In that
horizontal range where the inner square is drawn, two visplanes are
needed for the surrounding floor.
<p>
This leads to one of Doom's classic limitations which frustrated many
mappers for a long time. Doom contained a static limit on the number of
visplanes; if exceeded, it would crash back to DOS with the message,
&ldquo;No more visplanes!&rdquo;. The easiest way to invoke the visplane
limit is a large checkerboard floor pattern; this creates a large number
of visplanes.
<p>
As the segs are rendered, visplanes are also added, extending from the
edges of the segs towards the vertical edges of the screen. These extend
until they reach existing visplanes. Because of the way this works, the
system is dependent on the fact that segs are rendered in order by the
overall engine; it is necessary to draw close up visplanes first, so
that they can &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; by the further away ones. If
unstopped, the floor or ceiling will &ldquo;bleed out&rdquo; to the
edges of the screen, as previously described. Eventually, the visplanes
form a &ldquo;map&rdquo; of particular areas of the screen in which to
draw particular textures.
<p>
While visplanes are constructed essentially from vertical
&ldquo;strips&rdquo;, the actual low level rendering is performed in the
form of horizontal &ldquo;spans&rdquo; of texture. After all the
visplanes have been constructed, they are converted into spans which are
then rendered to the screen. This appears to be a tradeoff: it is easier
to construct visplanes as vertical strips, but because of the nature of
how the floor and ceiling textures appear it is easier to draw them as
horizontal strips. Because of the nature of visplanes, the conversion is
fairly trivial, however.

<h2> Things (Sprites) </h2>

<p>
Each sector within the level has a linked list of things stored in that
sector. As each sector is drawn the sprites are placed into a list of
sprites to be drawn. If not within the field of view these are ignored.
<p>
The edges of sprites are clipped by checking the list of segs previously
drawn. Sprites in Doom are stored in the same column based format as the
walls are, which again is useful for the renderer. The same functions
which are used to draw walls are used to draw sprites as well.
<p>
While ssectors are guaranteed to be in order, the sprites within them
are not. Doom stores a list of sprites to be drawn
(&ldquo;vissprites&rdquo;) and sorts the list before rendering. Far away
sprites are drawn before close ones. This causes some overdraw but
usually this is negligible.
<p>
There is a final issue of middle textures on 2-sided lines, used in
transparent bars for example. These are mixed in and drawn with the
sprites at the end of the rendering process, rather than with the other
walls.
