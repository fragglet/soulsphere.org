<h1> The design of E1M1 </h1>
<p>
Doom's first level, <i>E1M1: Hangar</i> is an iconic and memorable level,
but in the context of being the first level of the game, has a surprisingly
clever and interesting design. In January 2012 I wrote a bit about the
design of this level,

originally posted to the Doomworld forums</a> and reproduced below.

<p>
I've been thinking a bit about the design of Doom's first level. We've
all played through it a thousand times and probably don't give it much
thought. The way it's designed actually strikes me as quite clever, and
while I expect I'm almost certainly reading too much into it, I thought
these ideas might be interesting to others.
<p>
If you were given the task of designing the first level of Doom, what
would be your goals? Two main goals come to mind: firstly, the level is
the first level that will be seen by most players, so it should act as a
showcase for (what was then) the impressive technology of the engine.
Secondly, FPS games were not as popular then as they are now, so it
needs to (gently) introduce the player to basic concepts of the
gameplay.
<p>

<p>
This is the first thing a new player sees. For someone who has played
earlier games like Wolfenstein 3D the first view immediately showcases
some of the features of the new game engine. It's worth checking out the
Doom FAQ's section on
<a href="http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/sect1.html#3">
"What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?"</a> to understand what
I'm getting at. To summarize:

<blockquote><b>CHAPTER [3]: What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?</b><br />
[3-1]: Texture-Mapped Environment<br />
[3-2]: Non-Orthogonal Walls<br />
[3-3]: Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing<br />
[3-4]: Variable Height Floors and Ceilings<br />
[3-5]: Environment Animation and Morphing<br />
[3-6]: Palette Translation<br />
[3-7]: Multiple Players<br />
[3-8]: Smooth, Seamless Gameplay<br />
*3-9*: New Monsters and Artificial Intelligence</blockquote>
<p>
The first four of these points are immediately visible as soon as the
game starts (non-orthogonal walls are only subtly visible, but can be
seen in the initial view). You've got different floor and ceiling
heights, contrasting textures that demonstrate the texture mapping
effects, and some subtle lighting to show the lighting features. Moving
a few steps forward and looking out the window allows the player to see
the parallax skies/outdoor area.
<p>
From a functional perspective, what purpose does this area serve? My
hypothesis is that this initial starting area serves as a safe
&ldquo;sandpit&rdquo; for new players. Notice how, unless you're playing
on one of the higher difficulty settings, there are no monsters until
you go through the first door. Remember that many people playing Doom
for the first time in 1993 would never have seen or played an FPS
before. It's therefore useful that they have a safe area in which to get
used to the controls and how to move around. There are even a few
barrels to take pot shots at in case they want to try out the pistol.
<p>

<p>
This is also in the initial area. If you want to demonstrate &ldquo;Variable
Height Floors and Ceilings&rdquo;, what better option than a flight of stairs
to do that? The tech columns on the sides of the stairs have a pulsing
light effect which also provides a good demo of the lighting. Navigating
up a flight of stairs provides a minor challenge for a new player
getting used to the controls for the first time.
<p>
<img class="illustration" src="https://soulsphere.org/img/blog/doom-e1m1/E1M1-3.png">
<p>
Moving through the level, this is the next area encountered. You have to
open a door to proceed, so you're taught how to use the
&ldquo;use&rdquo; key before you leave the sandpit. The first zombie
troopers are immediately visible as soon as you open the door, but
they're a long way away and slow moving, so they don't pose much of a
threat to you. Any beginner / novice will be able to take them out
before they get very close, so the player learns to use the pistol if
they haven't already.
<p>
The area also serves as a further nice demo of the features of the
engine &mdash; lighting from the overhead lights, different floor and
ceiling heights, contrasting texturing with the computer consoles etc.
<p>

<p>
Now the slime pit room. As I see it, this room teaches the new player
two things. Firstly, damaging floors exist, and if it isn't immediately
obvious that the green slime is to be avoided, the player will quickly
find out. There's a minor challenge of navigating the zig-zag floor to
get to the other side.
<p>
Secondly, this is the first encounter with imps, so the player learns
imps throw fireballs, and gets an opportunity to practise avoiding
projectiles. A full-on face-to-face encounter with an imp is probably a
bit too much for a beginner player at this stage, so the imp is up on
the ledge where it's a sitting duck for the player to take out (or
simply avoid).
<p>
In graphical terms the biggest thing in this room is the animated floor
(&ldquo;Environment Animation and Morphing&rdquo; above). There's also a
nice subtle shadow effect with the sun shining through the window.
<p>
<img class="illustration" src="https://soulsphere.org/img/blog/doom-e1m1/E1M1-5.png">
<p>
After dealing with the imp on the ledge, the player now has the
challenge of going face to face against an imp, which of course can now
melee attack the player in addition to launching fireballs. As an
amusing aside, when I first played Doom, I thought this imp was the
&ldquo;boss&rdquo; of the first level. It seems reasonable that if a
player can defeat this imp they've probably learned enough to progress
to the second level, so while it may not really be a &ldquo;boss&rdquo;
as such it provides a good challenge.
<p>
The two candelabras next to the exit door serve perhaps as useful
signposts to attract the attention of the player if they're unsure where
to go next. There's also a barrel next to the imp, which an enterprising
player can use to take out the imp, learning how to use barrels
strategically.
<p>
Graphically this room also serves as a great demonstration of the
capabilities of the engine. The &ldquo;showdown&rdquo; against the imp
takes place in a dark, moodily lit room with an occasionally blinking
light, so you can see it coming towards you but not very well. It's
actually pretty spooky. If you want a scary environment, what better
than a monster walking towards you through a dark room?
<p>
From then on you've basically just got the exit room. There are a few
other things to note, like the secret corridor just before the imp room,
where perceptive players will perhaps spot the discrepancy in the wall
texture and find their way outside.
<p>
As I commented before, I'm probably reading too much &mdash; maybe
Romero didn't put anything like this much thought into the level when he
was designing it. But it does seem like a clever design. I'm reminded of
how, for example, Half Life 1 has its &ldquo;hazard course&rdquo; stage
that you can play through to learn the controls, or how the Portal games
teach the player each of the controls and concepts gradually. Doom
instead teaches the player invisibly, so you're learning how to do
things without even realising.
<p>
ADDENDUM: a couple of people have pointed out I forgot to mention John
Romero's
<a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/John_Romero#Design_rules">design
rules</a> that he applied when making Doom's levels. They are relevant
to note here because they explain a couple of features of E1M1's design,
such as the 'U' shape of the level:
<blockquote>
When designing levels for Doom, Romero came up with several rules, among them:
<ul><li>always changing floor height when I wanted to change floor textures
<li>using special border textures between different wall segments and doorways
<li>being strict about texture alignment
<li>conscious use of contrast everywhere in a level between light and
dark areas, cramped and open areas
<li>making sure that if a player could see outside that they should be
able to somehow get there
<li>being strict about designing several secret areas on every level
<li>making my levels flow so the player will revisit areas several times
so they will better understand the 3D space of the level
<li>creating easily recognizable landmarks in several places for easier
navigation
</ul>
</blockquote>
