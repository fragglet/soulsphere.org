I am working on a new version of the Mancubus: I'm renderind him like a big two-armed slug wit a big mouth and two cannon on the shoulders. 
But today I have seen the incredibles images of the new "Pinky" Demon and the two monster are very similiar (except of the cannons). I would like to post some *small* image to this community (tell me where) to know your advice if I can continue or if I must redesign the monster. 
Drawing any frame of an animated monster is a **lot** of work, so I would be sure that my fatigues are useful. 
Tnx
