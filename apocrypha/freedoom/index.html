<h1>The story of Freedoom</h1>

On June 26th 2001, <a href="http://doomworld.com/">Doomworld</a>
user <i>captmellow</i> posted a <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/doom-editing/491-barn-raising">thread</a>
titled &ldquo;barn-raising: open iwad project&rdquo;. The suggestion was that
the community of fans of the Doom games rally together to create a
full IWAD file. I had <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/4337">suggested</a> something
similar myself several days previously, but in a much more cautious
fashion.

<p>

The IWAD file is a single large file that contains everything apart
from program code that makes up Doom the game. All the levels,
textures, sound effects, music and graphics bundled up into a single
file, 14 megabytes in size. It was a very ambitious idea for a
project, probably more ambitious than any other embarked upon by
fans in Doom's history. The only comparable projects were commercial
ones, like <a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hacx">Hacx</a> and
total conversions, like <a
href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Batman_Doom">Batman Doom</a>.

<p>

Several days of discussion followed, including my emailing John
Carmack to ask about the legality of such a project. He gave the
idea a limited degree of blessing, while warning us to stay clear of
Id's trademarks. I set up some basic infrastructure and the project
took off to a quick start. In those early days it seemed like everyone
was eager to contribute to Freedoom, and submissions came pouring in
from many different people.

<p>

Above is the earliest screenshot I can find of Freedoom. It's dated to
July 10th 2001, only about a week after the project first started.
The earliest submissions focussed on putting together a complete set
of textures. Some of the submissions were slightly whimsical, as
shown. But they were constant, and every day I was incorporating new
textures and other material from people. The next screenshot is from
August 8th, almost a month later, and shows Doom's E1M4, with all the
visible graphics replaced.

<p>

archive.org has a snapshot of the <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010808222741/http://freedoom.despayre.org/">barebones
website</a> we had at this time. Most prominent were the linked status
lists for all the resources we were trying to replace. Lists like
these are really useful for motivating people: there's nothing better
than seeing a list of small outstanding tasks to be completed.
We also had a <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802110151/http://ice.alcopop.org/freedoom/">forum</a>
and IRC channel to coordinate work.

<p>

But while that technique works fine for knocking down lots of small
tasks, it's the larger, more complex tasks where it doesn't work so
well. A specific example is sprites. A typical monster can require 50
or more different sprites, for all the animation frames, and views
from different sides (Doom's monsters can be viewed from 8 different
angles). It's a lot more complicated than just drawing out a few
textures, and requires a art skills that very few people possess, plus
a lot of patience.

<p>

In September 2001 a user named &ldquo;Saint of Killers&rdquo; announced
that he was working on several sprites for Freedoom, which was great
news.  Here are some early sketches of what would eventually become
Freedoom's player, zombies and equivalent of Doom's Mancubus:

  <img src="art/saint_of_killers/man1real.gif" height="140">
</center>

<p>

All of these were eventually developed into a full set of sprites,
which Freedoom still uses to this day. But developing these into a
full set of sprites proved difficult work. The biggest problem was
that they were drawn out on paper by hand and scanned in. Sprites like
these have to be very carefully cropped in order to avoid any white
&ldquo;speckles&rdquo; around the edges from the surrounding paper. It's
also necessary to do some color adjustment on the sprites as they can
end up looking &ldquo;washed out&rdquo;.
<p>

Around the same time, we received replacements for the Imp and
Cacodemon. These were instead based on 3D models converted to sprites.

<p>

Despite this, by the end of October 2001, progress had seemingly
<a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/freedoom/3537-resurrect-freedoom/">ground
to a halt</a>, even though we now almost had a complete set of textures.
In February 2002 there was <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/freedoom/5510-a-few-changes/">more
discussion</a> about the drop in submissions. I <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/86866">suggested</a> making a
complete shareware WAD, as we were a good deal of the way there
already. I thought it would make a good short term goal, but
unfortunately the idea never really took off.

<p>

Later that year we faced a crisis as the project had outgrown its web
hosting (it was being hosted on Doomworld admin Arioch's home DSL
connection). I <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=200001&aid=602399&group_id=1">applied</a>
to Sourceforge for hosting and was initially rejected, but the
Sourceforge admins relented and took the project on-board. A few
months later they complained about the amount of bandwidth Freedoom
was using &mdash; it had used 4 gigabytes of bandwidth in a week! (a lot for
2003).
Following that complaint, I set up a proper release system and 
in April 2003, <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/freedoom/14498-0-1-release/">Freedoom
0.1</a> was released.
Until that point, Freedoom had simply been using a &ldquo;rolling
release&rdquo; system, with the current version always downloadable from the
website.

<p>

Some other things happened: Rellik created a spin-off project called
<a href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/doomworld-news/20336-freedm-emerges">FreeDM</a>,
intended to be a deathmatch-only version of Freedoom. Freedoom was <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/freedoom/26604-freedoom-in-debian/">accepted</a>
as a Debian package, allowing Doom source ports like PrBoom to move
into Debian's main repository. My own interest in Freedoom began to
decrease over time, and long-term contributor Jon Dowland took over
some of the work as co-maintainer to help out. We had a steady (but
slow) stream of submissions over the next few years, but the activity
level never returned to what was seen in those first few weeks.

<p>

In 2009 Mike Swanson <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/showthread.php?s=&threadid=45033">took
over as maintainer</a> and things have improved significantly since then.
Freedoom continues to get better all the time.

<h2> What worked? </h2>
<!--
technical mistakes
 - no version control
 - directory full of random files
 - release early, release often, or just don't do releases

motivating
 - providing lists
 - rule about replacing submissions
 - beep sound effect
 - try to make an attractive project that people want to contribute to
 - pov ray sprites

artistic direction
 - non existent
 - project run by technically minded people, artistic side was
   sidelined
 - never picked a story
 - cf. other projects like Urban Brawl, Plutonia 2, Back to Saturn X
 - just an arbitrary collection of material
