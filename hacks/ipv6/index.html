<h1>IPv6 Patches</h1>

<p> 

I worked as a Research Assistant at <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">
ECS, University of Southampton</a> over Summer 2003, with a focus on porting
games to IPv6. This was part of the 
<a href="http://www.6net.org/">6net project</a>. These are some patches to 
provide IPv6 support for various projects.

<h2>SDL_net</h2>

<p>
I have been working on porting 
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">SDL_net</a> to support
IPv6. SDL_net is a library aiming to provide networking support in an
abstracted cross-platform manner.  SDL_net was been designed, however,
to be oriented only toward IPv4. 
<p>

I have modified the API to SDL_net in a way that supports both IPv4 and
IPv6. Unfortunately this means that the new version of SDL_net is 
not API-compatible with the previous version. I have written a
<a href="newapi.html">porting guide</a> which summarises the changes.

<p>

Here is a <a href="sdlnet_diff">patch</a> to SDL_net-1.2.5 containing 
my changes.

<h2> Sopwith </h2>

Code to support the new version of SDL_net including IPv6 support is 
now in <a href="http://sdl-sopwith.sf.net/">Sopwith</a> CVS (see
sopwith/src/sdl/tcpcomm.c)

<h2> PrBoom </h2>

I have <a href="http://prboom.sf.net/">PrBoom</a> running over the 
new version of SDL_net. It needs some more work, however. Patches 
soon.

<h2> Scorched3D </h2>

<a href="http://www.scorched3d.co.uk/">Scorched-3D</a> is a clone of
"Scorched Earth". This also uses SDL_net. <a href="scorched_diff">patch</a>.

<h2> Irmo </h2>

<a href="http://irmo.sf.net/">Irmo</a> now includes proper IPv6 support.

<p>

<h2> Awstats </h2>

<a href="awstats_v6_diff">this patch</a> adds an extra graph to awstats which
displays bandwidth used by IPv4 against IPv6 hosts.
