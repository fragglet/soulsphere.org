<h1> Porting to the new SDL_net API </h1>

<p>
To support IPv6, the API for SDL_net has been changed.
This summarises the differences between the SDL_net 1.2.x and 
SDL_net 1.3.x.



<h2> IPaddress </h2>

The <tt>IPaddress</tt> structure is now not an IPv4 address, but rather
an abstracted "superclass" structure. The structure may hold an IPv4
address, or a IPv6 address, depending on its type. This means that you can
no longer use "<tt>address.host</tt>" as you could previously.

<p>
The first member of the new IPaddress structure
is "<tt>type</tt>". This indicates the type of address. These types are:

<pre>
typedef enum {
        SDLNET_ANY,
        SDLNET_IPV4,
        SDLNET_IPV6,
} SDLNet_AddrType;              
</pre>

ie. IPv4 addresses have <tt>address.type == SDLNET_IPV4</tt>, IPv6 addresses have
<tt>address.type == SDLNET_IPV6</tt>.  If you want to access the address data, 
you must cast to the particular address structure (IPaddress4 or 
IPaddress6). There are convenient macros named IP_ADDRESS4 and 
IP_ADDRESS6 provided for this purpose.

<pre>
	IPaddress addr;

	// ....

	printf("%i\n", IP_ADDRESS4(&addr)->host);
</pre>

In general, it is better to avoid dependency on a particular address
type where possible. Instead, try to use DNS names.

<h2>SDLNet_PresentIP</h2>

In general, the new API tries to discourage dependencies on particular 
types of address (IPv4 or IPv6) and encourage use of DNS names instead.
For this reason, the SDLNet_PresentIP function has been added. When 
presenting an IP address as a string, do not generate the string by hand,
but use the SDLNet_PresentIP function instead to convert it. eg.

<pre>
	IPaddress addr;

	// ....

	printf("New connection from %s!\n", SDLNet_PresentIP(&addr));
</pre>

<h2>SDLNet_ResolveHost</h2>

SDLNet_ResolveHost has an extra parameter to allow specifying the type of 
address to resolve. eg.

<pre>
	IPaddress addr;

	// resolve foo.bar.com:4378 as an IPv4 address

	SDLNet_ResolveHost(SDLNET_IPV4, &addr, "foo.bar.com", 4378);

	// resolve baz.qux.org:8539 as an IPv6 address

	SDLNet_ResolveHost(SDLNET_IPV6, &addr, "baz.qux.org", 8539);
</pre>

Previously, one way to check if a resolve had failed was to check if
<tt>addr.host == INADDR_NONE</tt>. Do not do this. Instead check
the return value of SDLNet_ResolveHost.

<pre>
	IPaddress addr;

	if (SDLNet_ResolveHost(SDLNET_IPV4, &addr, "shoenix.org", 8201) &lt; 0) {
		printf("Resolve failed!\n");
	}
</pre>	

<h2>SDLNet_TCP_Open</h2>

Previously, the way to create a TCP socket was with SDLNet_TCP_Open. This
was used both for creating server sockets and connecting to remote hosts.
This function has now been removed: instead use SDLNet_TCP_OpenServer
to create a server socket and SDLNet_TCP_Connect to connect to a remote
machine.
<p>
To create a server:
<pre>
	TCPsocket sock;

	// create a new IPv4 server on port 8592

	sock = SDLNet_TCP_OpenServer(SDLNET_IPV4, 8592);

</pre>

To connect to a remote host, given a pointer to an IPaddress structure 
<tt>addr</tt>:

<pre>
	TCPsocket sock;

	sock = SDLNet_TCP_Connect(addr);
</pre>


<h2>SDLNet_UDP_Open</h2>

When creating a UDP socket, you must now specify the type of socket to
create. For example:

<pre>
	UDPsocket sock;

	// create a new IPv4 socket on port 8201

	sock = SDLNet_UDP_Open(SDLNET_IPV4, 8201);

	// create a new IPv6 socket on port 9182

	sock = SDLNet_UDP_Open(SDLNET_IPV6, 9182);
</pre>

<h2>SDLNET_ANY</h2>

As well as the SDLNET_IPV4 and SDLNET_IPV6 address types, there is also
a third, SDLNET_ANY. Some hostnames have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
bound to them. Passing SDLNET_ANY to SDLNet_ResolveHost will attempt
to resolve both types. If the name given resolves to an address of 
either type, it will be returned. If it resolves to <i>both</i> types,
the <t>IPaddress</t> structure is filled in to contain both addresses,
and given <tt>addr.type == SDLNET_ANY</tt>.
<p>
This <tt>IPaddress_any</tt> structure can then be passed to 
SDLNet_TCP_Connect, which will try to connect on both address types.
For example:

<pre>
	IPaddress addr;
	TCPsocket sock;

	if (SDLNet_ResolveHost(SDLNET_ANY, &addr, "shoe.bar.com", 9281) < 0) {
		printf("Resolve failed!\n");
		exit(-1);
	}

	sock = SDLNet_TCP_Connect(&addr);
</pre>

It is then unneccesary when connecting to a host to try to resolve and
connect to it as both IPv4 and IPv6 separately, as this is taken care 
of by the underlying library.
<p>
Note that in creating a server with <tt>SDLNet_TCP_OpenServer</tt>, or
when using UDP, you must still explicitely specify the address type
(ie. you cannot pass SDLNET_ANY as the socket type).
