<h1> Logging with ircd-hybrid </h1>

This is a patch for <a href="http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/">ircd-hybrid</a>
to add full logging of almost all activity. It dumps all conversations 
(both private and public) and connections/disconnections to the server
 to a file, <i>activity.log</i>. 

<ul>
<li> <a href="logging_patch">logging_patch</a>. This is against ircd-hybrid
	7.0.
<li> <a href="splitlog">splitlog script</a>. This is a ruby script which takes
	the generated logs and splits them into hyperlinked HTML files, 
	allowing the information and conversations from the log to be browsed
	via a web browser.

</ul> 

<h3> Notes </h3>

<ul>
<li> <tt>src/s_log.c</tt> contains the line: 

	<blockquote><tt>
	fflush(activity_log_file);
	</tt></blockquote>

     This flushes the log file after every line written to the log file.
     This allows you to view the log in real time with <tt>tail -f</tt>. 
     For higher performance you might want to comment this out.

<li> This has not been tested under high load. 
</ul>
