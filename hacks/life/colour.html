<h3> How it works </h3>

<p>
The Applet uses all the conventional rules of the Life game but
also assigns the squares colour values. I had a look at LifeGenesis
from the Microsoft Entertainment Pack to see how it implements
colour. This version of life had two colours, red and
blue. Essentially both colours are treated exactly the same. The only
addition to the algorithm which the Microsoft Programmers made was in
the creation of new cells. When this happens, the most common parent
colour is used for the child colour:

I managed to implement the same system in my applet fairly easily,
however I found it to be rather boring only having 2 colours. To
'spice it up', I decided to make the colour values continuous rather
than discrete. Instead of choosing the most common parent colour, the
parent colours are all added together and an average taken. This
colour is used for the new cell. In essence, the cells now have a
crude form of 'genetics' where new cells pick up a 'blend' of their
parent cells characteristics.

Interestingly, if a random board is run for long enough, the
colours tend to average out and regions develop with particular colours:
