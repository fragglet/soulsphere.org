<h1> Sinclair QL disks </h1>

<img src="worm-thumbnail.png" align="right">

I first learnt programming at around age 9 in the early 1990s, on a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL</a>. The
native storage format for the QL was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Microdrive">microdrive cassettes</a>,
which were notoriously unreliable, slow and had a tiny capacity. Fortunately,
my QL was equipped with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_Systems">trump card</a> 
expansion card, providing additional memory and floppy disk storage.

<p>

Recently, I dumped the contents of some of my old floppy disks to files
and wrote some scripts to decode the contents.

<h2> Filesystem format </h2>

The QL disk file system format is a modified version of the format used
on the original microdrive cassettes.  I have written
<a href="fs.html">about the filesystem format.</a>

<h2> Scripts </h2>

Various scripts for extracting the contents of the disks.  These are all
written in Python.

<ul>
<li> <a href="scripts/qldumper">Filesystem dumper</a>.  This reads QL 
     disks that have been dumped using the Unix <tt>dd</tt> command,
     and extracts all of the files that it finds on the file system.

<li> <a href="scripts/convert-image">Image converter</a> for image files 
     in the QL screen format.  This can be used to convert files stored
     using eg. <tt>SBYTES flp1_image, 131072, 32768</tt> (which is used
     as an example in the QL manual) into PNG format files.
</ul>

<h2> QL software </h2>

This is some software that I managed to extract from the disks:

<ul>
<li> <a href="interesting/arcade">arcade</a>
     - Some kind of arcade game?
<li> <a href="interesting/BOMBER">BOMBER</a>
<li> <a href="interesting/HARRY2">HARRY2</a>
     - "Hungry Harry", I seem to remember this was like pacman.
<li> <a href="interesting/hunt">hunt</a>
     - "Treasure Hunt, by Halvor Heuch"
<li> <a href="interesting/startrek">startrek</a> 
     - A QL version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(text_game)">Star Trek</a>
<li> <a href="interesting/vampire">vampire</a> - The Vampire's Castle Adventure
<li> <a href="ql-games.tar.gz">A disk of QL games</a> including Psion Chess.
</ul>

<h2> Raw disk images </h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="diskimg/xchange1.img.zip">Psion XChange</a> office suite.
<li> <a href="diskimg/games1.img.zip">Various games</a> (same contents as link above).
</ul>

<h2> My own stuff </h2>

Various notable programs of my own creation

<ul>
<li> <a href="interesting/mine/1ST">1ST</a> - The first program I wrote
<li> <a href="interesting/mine/ai">ai</a> - Some kind of misguided attempt at artificial intelligence
<!--<li> <a href="interesting/mine/figlet-like">figlet-like</a> 
     - ASCII art letters, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIGlet">figlet</a>-->
<li> <a href="interesting/mine/house3">house3</a> 
     - Somewhat odd text adventure
<li> <a href="interesting/mine/qldos">qldos</a>
     - An attempt at emulating MS/DOS!
</ul>

<h2> Other stuff </h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="worm.png">A worm</a> (I remember this program displayed a
     message saying "dedicated to new age music")
</ul>
