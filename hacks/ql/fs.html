<h1> Sinclair QL floppy disk file system format </h1>

The drive for my QL was only capable of reading 720KiB disks (double density);
fortunately, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_format">physical encoding</a>
used was identical to PC disks.  As a result it was possible to dump the 
contents of the disks to files using the Unix <tt>dd</tt> command.  However,
the layout of the sectors on the disks was rather unusual.

<h2> Sector layout </h2>

Data on floppy disks is stored in <i>tracks</i>.  These are concentric 
circles on the disk surface.  Each track is then divided up into <i>sectors</i>.
For the QL (and the PC), a 720KiB disk has 80 tracks, with 9 sectors per
track.  Each sector stores 512 bytes. The disks are double sided, so data is
stored on each side.

<p>

<strike>
On PC disks, sectors are arranged "linearly" as follows: the first sector
of the disk is located on the first sector of the first track.  Reading then
proceeds through each sector of the first track, then the sectors from the
first track on the opposite side of the disk are read. Reading then proceeds
to the second track back on the first side, and the sequence repeats.
</strike>

<p>

<strike>
For the QL disks, things are different.  I am not sure what the reason
for the different layout is - it may be for efficiency or perhaps it was
easier to program.  The file system is based on logical
blocks that are 1536 bytes in length (three sectors).  These blocks are
"interleaved" within a track - sectors alternate between the three blocks
stored on the track. So, a track actually looks like this:
</strike>

<p>

The above two paragraphs might not be completely accurate.
Since writing this document, I discovered the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaving_(disk_storage)">
sector interleaving</a> that was used to give the CPU time to to process
data as it was read from disk. So that explains the unusual sector
ordering. But as the disks were read from a PC, I'm unsure whether the
ordering is the result of PC floppies being interleaved or because QL
floppies are interleaved.

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th> Sector     <th> Details
<tr> <td> 0          <td> Block 0, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 1          <td> Block 1, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 2          <td> Block 2, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 3          <td> Block 0, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 4          <td> Block 1, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 5          <td> Block 2, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 6          <td> Block 0, Sector 2
<tr> <td> 7          <td> Block 1, Sector 2
<tr> <td> 8          <td> Block 2, Sector 2
</table>
</blockquote>

To read a complete block, you must therefore read the first sector, jump
forward three sectors, read the second sector, then jump forward three
more sectors and read the third sector.
<p>
In fact, things are more complicated than that.  The blocks are grouped by
track and read from alternate sides, so the first block is read from the
first side, while the second block is read from the second side, etc. The
sector layout actually looks like this:

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th colspan="2">Side 0             <th colspan="2">Side 1
<tr> <th> Sector <th> Details           <th> Sector <th> Details
<tr> <td> 0      <td> Block 0, Sector 0 <td> 0      <td> Block 1, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 1      <td> Block 2, Sector 0 <td> 1      <td> Block 3, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 2      <td> Block 4, Sector 0 <td> 2      <td> Block 5, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 3      <td> Block 0, Sector 1 <td> 3      <td> Block 1, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 4      <td> Block 2, Sector 1 <td> 4      <td> Block 3, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 5      <td> Block 4, Sector 1 <td> 5      <td> Block 5, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 6      <td> Block 0, Sector 2 <td> 6      <td> Block 1, Sector 2
<tr> <td> 7      <td> Block 2, Sector 2 <td> 7      <td> Block 3, Sector 2
<tr> <td> 8      <td> Block 4, Sector 2 <td> 8      <td> Block 5, Sector 2
</table>
</blockquote>

In fact, it's even more complicated than that!  The above diagram is
accurate for the
first track on the drive; however, on each track, the sectors are <i>offset</i>
by an amount equal to the track number multiplied by four, so the second
track has an offset of 4, the third has an offset of 8, etc.  This is what 
the second track (offset of 4) looks like:

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th colspan="2">Side 0              <th colspan="2">Side 1
<tr> <th> Sector <th> Details            <th> Sector <th> Details
<tr> <td> 0      <td> Block 8, Sector 1  <td> 0      <td> Block 9, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 1      <td> Block 10, Sector 1 <td> 1      <td> Block 11, Sector 1
<tr> <td> 2      <td> Block 6, Sector 2  <td> 2      <td> Block 7, Sector 2
<tr> <td> 3      <td> Block 8, Sector 2  <td> 3      <td> Block 9, Sector 2
<tr> <td> 4      <td> Block 10, Sector 2 <td> 4      <td> Block 11, Sector 2
<tr> <td> 5      <td> Block 6, Sector 0  <td> 5      <td> Block 7, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 6      <td> Block 8, Sector 0  <td> 6      <td> Block 9, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 7      <td> Block 10, Sector 0 <td> 7      <td> Block 11, Sector 0
<tr> <td> 8      <td> Block 6, Sector 1  <td> 8      <td> Block 7, Sector 1
</table>
</blockquote>

<h2> File system </h2>

The file system is similar to the microdrive file system (details of which
can be found in [1]).  The first block
on the disk is a special block containing a <i>sector map</i>; I will refer
to it as the <i>block map</i> instead, to keep terminology consistent and
avoid confusion.  The block map is an array of records, one for each 
block on the disk (480 on a 720KiB disk).  It begins 96 bytes from the
start of the first block. Each record is three bytes long;
the first byte and the top four bits of the second byte form a file number,
while the lower four bits of the second byte and the third byte form a
sequence number.

<p>

To read a file, the blocks with that file number are read in sequence,
for each sequence number in succession.  For example, to read file 5, a
three block file, the blocks with entries (5, 0), (5, 1) and (5, 2) are
read.

<p>

The contents of each file are prefixed with a 64 byte header, with the
exception of the directory file (which is file 0).  This appears to be 
left over from the old microdrive format.  The header contains a copy of
the file's name, but this does not seem to be updated when the file is
renamed. The "definitive" name for the file is stored in the file's entry
in the directory. Other than this, there seems to be no other useful 
information stored in the header.

<h2> Directory </h2>

The directory contains a list of all of the files stored in the file
system.  It is itself stored as a file inside file 0.  Each record is
64 bytes in length.  The first record is empty (as this corresponds to
file 0, which is the directory itself).  All integer values are
big-endian. The record format looks like this:

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr> <th> Offset (hex)  <th> Length (hex) <th> Purpose

<tr> <td> 0             <td> 4            <td> File length
<tr> <td> E             <td> 2            <td> 16-bit filename length
<tr> <td> 10            <td> 24           <td> Filename
<tr> <td> 34            <td> 4            <td> Modification date

</table>
</blockquote>

When extracting files, it is worth noting that QL filenames can
contain '/' characters, which cannot be used in filenames on Unix
systems.  They can also contain various other characters that cannot
be used in filenames under various other operating systems (eg.
Windows).

<p>

The modification date uses a similar scheme to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a> in
counting seconds since an epoch; however, the epoch is different.
Unix time measures seconds since 1970, but the epoch here is 1961 (for
reasons unknown to me).  To convert to Unix time, simply subtract
284000400. I was able to calibrate this by using various text files on
the disks that I examined that contained textual representations of
the date and time that they were created.

<p>

Deleted files have their length and filename length fields set to
zero, so it is possible to recover files after they have been deleted.
