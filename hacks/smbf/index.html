<h1> Self-modifying Brainfuck </h1>

<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a></b> is
a useful general purpose procedural programming language, elegant in
its simplicity.  However, the language uses a "Harvard" architecture,
which separates instructions from data.  As a result, some programming
paradigms which are possible in other languages are impossible in Brainfuck.
<p>
Self-modifying Brainfuck extends the Brainfuck language to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von
Neumann Architecture</a>, placing the
program code on the same "tape" which the program uses to store data.  As
a result, it is possible to write programs which modify themselves while
running.  This feature also brings introspection abilities (sometimes
called "Reflection" or "Reflectance"), allowing Brainfuck programs
to read their own source code.

<h3> Source code </h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="smbf.rb">smbf.rb</a> - Ruby version (first implementation)
<li><a href="smbf.c">smbf.c</a> - C version
</ul>
<h3> Examples </h3>
Examples can be found <a href="examples/">here</a>.
<h3> Technical </h3>
The program source code is placed immediately to the "left" of the 
data pointer's "origin" point (the location of the data pointer at 
the start of program execution).  The source code is inserted
left-to-right, so that the last character of the source file
is immediately left of the origin.
For example, the following 
program prints the last character of the source file:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;.</tt></blockquote>
In normal Brainfuck, attempting to access data left of the 
origin will produce undefined results.  As a result, Self-Modifying
Brainfuck can technically be described as a backwards-compatible derivative of 
normal Brainfuck.
However, some Brainfuck interpreters allow data left of the origin to be
accessed.  Programs which rely on this behavior may not run correctly
as a result of this alternate behavior.
