    <h1>BrainFuck.Net</h1>


    <p>
      As part of their <i>.Net</i> initiative, Microsoft have created a VM 
      which is not only platform independent (theoretically anyway) but 
      also language independent. You can develop for .Net in VB.Net, 
      C++ or C#, Microsoft's Java clone. Microsoft have commissioned several
      other people to port languages to the .Net platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in typical Microsoft style, they have totally overlooked one 
      of the most important and useful languages! I speak, of course, of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Brainfuck is designed to be one the most compact languages possible
      while still being turing complete. While brainfuck has only 8
      commands, it is still theoretically possible to do anything in it
      that can be done in other languages. The 8 brainfuck commands are:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr> <td> + </td> <td> Increment value under pointer </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> - </td> <td> Decrement value under pointer </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> > </td> <td> Increment pointer </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> < </td> <td> Decrement pointer </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> [ </td> <td> Loop while value under pointer is nonzero </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> ] </td> <td> End of loop </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> , </td> <td> Read character from input into pointer </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> . </td> <td> Output value under pointer to screen </td> </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      To remedy this tragic oversight on the part of Microsoft, I have 
      written a compiler to compile brainfuck code to the MSIL VM.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Newsflash!</b> The Portable.Net compiler now includes
      <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/dotgnu-pnet/pnet/cscc/bf/">a brainfuck frontend</a>.
      Credit for this goes to <a href="mailto:gopalv82@NOSPAM.symonds.net">
      Gopal.V</a>. It generates the same code as my compiler does, although
      the source is from scratch.

    <h3> FAQ </h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li> 
	Does this work with the Microsoft IL Assembler? <br>
	I have no idea. I use the <a href="http://www.dotgnu.org/">DotGNU</a>
	Portable.Net implementation of the IL Assembler. There should 
	be no reason why the Microsoft Assembler will not assemble the
	IL code outputted by the compiler, but the compiler may pass
	options to ilasm that the Microsoft Assembler will not understand.

      <li> 
	Does this run under Windows? <br>
	Its rumoured to run in <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">
	CygWin</a> and also <a href="http://www.delorie.com/">DJGPP</a>.
	All my development for this was done under Linux.
	
      <li>
	Is the BrainFuck.Net language different to ordinary BrainFuck? <br>
	Unlike other impure languages which have had to change their syntax
	in order to run in the CVM, BrainFuck is flexible enough that
	there is no need to alter the syntax.

      <li>
	Could this be modified to work with the JVM? <br>
	Yes, very easily infact. You're welcome to do it if you want.

      <li>
	Shouldn't you write this in C#? <br>
	No, now go away.

      <li>
	Can I use BrainFuck.Net to write webservices? <br>
	<strike>No. Well, probably not.</strike> Yes! Using the Portable.Net
        frontend, now you CAN write webservices in bf.net. Yet another 
        example of the crazy world we live in :)

      <li>
	Does BrainFuck.Net use the controversial Microsoft Passport system
	for authentication? <br>
	No. The Brainfuck language has only 8 commands, and none of them
	are related to authenticating remote network users.
